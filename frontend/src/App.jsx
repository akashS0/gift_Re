      "Gift Re is proposed as an AI-native global reinsurer based in GIFT City, India's International Financial Services Centre. The global reinsurance market is growing at 10–11% a year and the Indian market at roughly 15%, with foreign reinsurers gaining share against the state-backed GIC Re.",
      "Two capabilities differentiate the venture: machine-learning management of the investment float, and generative-AI synthetic data for pricing catastrophe and other rare risks. The investment MVP, trained on 16 years of data for 1,000 companies and backtested over 4 years, outperforms the benchmark indices. Projections support a path to USD 300M+ gross premium within three years on a lean cost base.",

On the asset side it covers BiLSTM, CNN, Random Forest and Temporal Fusion Transformer models for time-series and stock selection, and the Sharpe and Treynor measures used to judge risk-adjusted performance.",
      "Gaps identified: reinsurers apply AI mostly to underwriting and claims, rarely to float and capital management; actuarial and investment functions operate in silos; and traditional CAT models struggle with low-frequency, high-severity, data-scarce perils such as climate and cyber.",

Expected outcome: better Sharpe and Treynor ratios, more efficient float deployment and higher ROCE while holding solvency and liquidity.",
      "H2 — Synthetic data from GANs and VAEs will improve the accuracy, stability and fairness of pricing for rare or emerging risks compared with traditional actuarial and catastrophe models. Expected outcome: better capture of tail frequency and severity, lower margins for adverse deviation, and a narrower protection gap.",

On the asset side, three themes emerged: limitations of traditional ALM, ML for dynamic asset allocation, and explainability as the price of regulatory acceptance. On the liability side: data scarcity, the sensitivity of CAT models to small assumption errors, and synthetic data as a complement rather than a replacement for real experience.",
      "A recurring observation was that investment and underwriting risks are treated as independent, when systemic events such as a pandemic or a major catastrophe hit both sides of the balance sheet at once.",

const QUESTIONS = [
  { q: "Q2–Q3", h: "Background", title: "Expert backgrounds", finding: "Senior leaders with 20+ years across RBC and IFRS. Most are becoming acquainted with AI and ML, but current adoption remains low." },
  { q: "Q4", h: "Both", title: "Drivers of ROCE", finding: "Views split: pricing and underwriting discipline; risk selection and diversification (more critical for reinsurers than insurers); and float management — reinsurers hold over 2x annual premium as float, so a small yield gain compounds into a large advantage." },
  { q: "Q5", h: "H1", title: "Current investment practice", finding: "Long-term government instruments for safety and liquidity. No in-house equity or alternatives teams. Strategy driven by duration or bucket-wise cash-flow matching. Asset and liability data sit in silos, reviewed quarterly rather than in real time." },
  { q: "Q6", h: "H1", title: "Limitations of traditional ALM", finding: "Nominal fixed-income hedges create real-return mismatches against inflation-linked claims. Duration matching only works for parallel yield-curve shifts. Short-tail lines force everything into T-bills. Investment and underwriting risk are treated as independent, which systemic events disprove." },
  { q: "Q7", h: "H1", title: "ML for asset allocation and stock selection", finding: "ML can adjust allocation dynamically from large unstructured inputs such as sentiment, and move beyond linear quant limits. Random Forests and Gradient Boosting capture nonlinear patterns across regimes." },
  { q: "Q8", h: "H1", title: "Superior risk-adjusted returns", finding: "Agreement that ML can generate alpha; debate over whether allocation or selection matters more. Cautions: low signal-to-noise in financial data, regime breaks, transaction costs from frequent rebalancing. Consensus favours AI assisting a human investment team." },
  { q: "Q9", h: "H1", title: "Capital efficiency and ROCE", finding: "Liquidity for catastrophe claims is the binding constraint. Deep networks reading weather and supply-chain data could predict liquidity needs, letting reinsurers hold cash only when claim events are likely and deploy the rest of the float into higher-yielding assets." },
  { q: "Q10", h: "H1", title: "Regulatory and liquidity constraints", finding: "Algorithmic monoculture risk: similar models on similar data could trigger simultaneous fire sales. Risk-based capital charges on equity volatility may offset yield gains, so models must optimise return per unit of capital, not just return." },
  { q: "Q11", h: "H2", title: "Traditional models and rare risks", finding: "Rare events lack the history traditional pricing needs; estimates become unstable. Independence assumptions fail — a catastrophe hits millions of policies and can crash markets at the same time. Old data may mislead where climate has shifted." },
  { q: "Q12", h: "H2", title: "Where CAT models fall short", finding: "A 1–2% assumption error can move estimated loss by 25–50%, so actuaries add large margins for adverse deviation, pushing premiums and capital up and products out of reach. GANs and VAEs can generate thousands of realistic scenarios instead of waiting decades." },
  { q: "Q13", h: "H2", title: "Role of synthetic data — GANs and VAEs", finding: "Strong supporting tool. WGAN-GP learns the statistical shape of extreme events without rigid assumptions and can combine perils (cyclone plus supply-chain collapse) that have never co-occurred but are plausible. For 1-in-100/200 events, synthetic scenarios fill the data gap." },
  { q: "Q14", h: "H2", title: "Adoption barriers", finding: "GANs only recombine what they have seen; a novel peril (AI-driven cyberattack) can yield realistic-looking but meaningless output. Actuaries are sceptical; regulators are unlikely to allow lower reserves justified solely on synthetic data." },
  { q: "Q15–Q17", h: "H2", title: "Accuracy and operational issues", finding: "ML improves pricing accuracy but needs rebuilt infrastructure: automated pipelines, parallel processing, containerised deployment. Explainability is essential. Actuaries trace every assumption; data scientists iterate on correlations — a cultural gap HR must manage." },
  { q: "Q18–Q19", h: "Both", title: "The AI-native reinsurer advantage", finding: "Building from scratch enables real-time ALM with daily portfolio adjustment from liability data, joint projection of assets and liabilities, and better modelling of the correlation between market risk and claims risk under RBC — releasing capital." },
  { q: "Q20", h: "H2", title: "Closing the protection gap", finding: "Many Indians are uninsured for lack of documents. ML underwriting on alternative data (utility bills, satellite imagery) and real-time climate or IoT wellness data can both extend cover and prevent claims." },

      <H2>Cross-cutting findings</H2>
      <P><span className="font-semibold">Familiarity breeds acceptance.</span> Receptiveness to ML rose with self-rated familiarity (Spearman ρ = 0.47, p = 0.03). Some resistance is unfamiliarity, so training — through actuarial societies and universities — is itself an adoption lever, not just a precondition.</P>
      <P><span className="font-semibold">The barrier is one system.</span> Respondents who raised talent scarcity also tended to raise cultural resistance, cost and the hybrid path: practitioners see adoption as a connected problem rather than separate hurdles.</P>
      <P><span className="font-semibold">Hybrid beats AI-native.</span> 90% favoured established firms adopting AI-native ways of working over displacement by new entrants. An AI-native reinsurer has real advantages — clean data, staff built around the model, governance designed in — but reinsurance is a trust-, capital- and relationship-intensive business that takes years to build. Reinsurers were most optimistic; consultants most cautious, citing rating-agency credibility. The regulator is technology-neutral but would scrutinise a new entrant's risk-based capital more closely.</P>
      <P><span className="font-semibold">One balance sheet.</span> Several respondents named the integration of asset and liability modelling — treating a catastrophe's claims and its market shock as one event — as the most powerful use of ML. That is the bridge between Model A and Model B in this portal.</P>
      <P><span className="font-semibold">Explainability limits the method.</span> Pricing should use interpretable models — GLMs, or gradient-boosted trees with SHAP explanations — rather than opaque deep networks. Several respondents also warned synthetic data could reduce fairness by carrying forward hidden bias.</P>

      <H2>Limitations</H2>
      <P>The sample is concentrated in India, so regulatory comments are IRDAI-specific, and skews toward long-duration life and health rather than short-tail general insurance. All coding was by one person; a second coder on about 30% of transcripts is recommended for the full dissertation. Attitude scores are interpretive, and the study is a snapshot.</P>
